*Preface: For true decentralization and openness we've decided to open source 3 years of work for Datamine Network dApp. We believe this will close another gap of centralization and bring us closer to true vision of DeFi.*

# Realtime Decentralized Dashboard

Instant access to Datamine (DAM), FLUX and on-chain Uniswap USD pricing. 

This realtime analytics dashboard builds feature:

- FULL PRIVACY MODE: For privacy and decentralization reasons everything is self-contained in this repository, **NO ANALYTICS, TRACKING, COOKIES, EXTERNAL RESOURCES or 3rd parties** are utilized in our Ethereum multi-smart contract decentralized dApp. 
- No Installation Required: Just drag & drop this onto any local or remote web server.
- Full Version History: Pick and download any previous build of the dashboard.
- Minified: Our single-page application (SPA) app will take up less than 3 MB in uncompressed form.
- Works in any folder structure. Drop this into a subfolder or a subdomain, all paths are relative.
- IPFS, SWARM & TOR compatible. Move one step closer to true decentralization by hosting our dashboard on Distributed Web.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally you will need to download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en

This project was originally developed using Node v16 but it's compatible with Node v18. (This node version was forced with Docker which might be added to this source code in the future.)

## Installation

1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Type in `set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`. If you are using Linux or macOS type in `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` instead. (This is only needed if you are using Node v18)
3. Run `npm install` (this is a one time requirement). If you get `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'package.json'` then you did not complete previous step

## Running dApp Locally

After completing previous getting started steps you can now run the project:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Configuration

- check out [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for customization
- You can add in `?devLog=1` to url to get a console output for debugging 3rd party wallet connection. See `vconsole` npm package in [package.json](package.json) for more info.
- [src/core/helpArticles.ts](src/core/helpArticles.ts) contains our unique "instant help desk" solution. You can modify help articles here and they'll be added to "Help" tab
- [src/core/web3/web3Reducer.ts](src/core/web3/web3Reducer.ts) contains the main state & reducer of the project and contains all the actions user can perform
- [src/core/web3/Web3Bindings.ts](src/core/web3/Web3Bindings.ts) contains all the handling of recuder queries (async logic)

This project does not contain any unit tests but this can be improved in the future.

## To Deploy

### `npm run build` or `yarn run build`

This will create a new build in build/ folder that you can host. We currently host this on github(https://datamine-crypto.github.io/realtime-decentralized-dashboard/) for decentralization reasons & proof of builds.

The builds can be hosted in subfolders and do not perform external http calls for security & decentralization.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Be sure `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` is in .env file
